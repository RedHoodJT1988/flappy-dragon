# Flappy Dragon
This is a game written in the Rust programming language that mimics the gameplay
mechanics of the classic game Flappy Bird. At this current stage the game only
runs in a terminal window using the excellent Bracket-lib package for Rust. 
If you choose to download the code for the game please feel free to modify
the settings to your liking. 

## TODOS
I plan on coming back to this project and changing some of the settings pertaining 
to the Gravity Level, Velocity and Game Speed. I would also like to try my hand
at creating my own 2D Sprites and add them to the game instead of using the ASCII
characters. Once I have the graphics in place and have tested them I will also try
to mimic the size of the sprites to that of Flappy Bird for an even greater play
style similar to that of Flappy Bird. Bracket-lib also offers a flexible console
feature that allows the player coordinates to be set to floating point numbers 
so I will be taking a look at how to implement that which should help with 
smoother movement. 

## Small Project
This was just a small project to get my feet wet so to speak in the Rust programming
language. I am enjoying the language and the projects that I can build with the language
so far. I will have more in the coming days/months. Stay tuned.
